**Under construction**.


* Is NTK the only explanation? Almost surely not.

* The crux of NTK: weights don't move very much from their (random) inits

* Therefore, meaningful feature learning does not happen!

* However, we know (both from visualizations as well as controlled experiments) that neural networks *do* learn features using GD.

* *Hessian control*: a theory that explains dynamics "far away" from the initialization.
